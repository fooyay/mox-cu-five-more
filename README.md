# Moccasin Project

🐍 Welcome to your Moccasin project!

## Quickstart

1. Deploy to a fake local network that titanoboa automatically spins up!

```bash
mox run deploy
```

2. Run tests

```
mox test
```

## Workshop
Added a new module, double_it.vy, which acts like favorites but stores a double of what you store.
Initialized it and called it from the five_more.vy contract. 

Added an example of "uses" and "initializes" in ownable_2step.vy, which imports ownable.vy.
